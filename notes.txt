- overview & concepts
    - USFM
        - reference to spec
        - basic syntax
        - markers
        - paragraph vs character/note
        - version of spec handled
    - multiple hierarchies
    - "the overlap problem" and overlapping content
        "above and below", "before and after"
    - milestones vs containers 
    - parsers vs processors
        - this is a parser, not a processor
        - get_text() vs get_value()
        - it's your responsibility to follow the whitespace rules.
    - Elements
        - both markers and containers
- synopsis
    - common examples
- quickstart
    - Parsing
    -   (tokenizing)
    - Using the parse results
        - markers, containers, and elements
        - elements
            - parser.results
            - yield
        - Matchers
            ElementMatcher usage
        - searching & processing horizontally (with milestones)
            - retrieving a milestone
            - methods
        - searching & processing vertically (with containers))
            - methods
        - .rN /.cN
    - whitespace
        - preservation rules
        - get_text() returning whitespace and why
            - always preserves significant whitespace
            - when it normalizes
            
        - tips
            - use .value or get_value() if you don't care about / need whitespace (won't always give a str)
            - otherwise use .text or get_text and don't strip() - will preserve significant whitespace
            - don't use .text / get_text() and strip 
- FAQ
    - Can i parse arbitary fragments of USFM?
        - some - sstarting with a character/note marker won't work.
- performance
- class docs
- constructing your own trees
    - flattening / searching - add, search, add wont find second lot of elements
- extending the parser
    - adding Paragraph or Note/Character classes
